    <p id = "bio">Hi! I'm Derrick, a third year majoring in Data Science and Business with a minor in Psychology. <br>
         I was born and raised in the Bay Area and even though I'm a third year,
         I don't think I'll ever get used to the cold here in Boston (nothing can top California weather). <br>
          I love to play a wide variety of sports and I'm currently playing  on the men's club basketball team here at Northeastern. <br>
           In my free time, I love to play chess, read, cook, workout, explore Boston, thrift, and play some poker with friends.</p>

    <p> Some things that I would like to add to this website in the future are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>animations</li>
      <li>cooler colors and font sizes</li>
      <li>more user interaction</li>
    </ul>
